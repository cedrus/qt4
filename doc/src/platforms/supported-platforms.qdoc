    \title Supported Platforms
    \brief The platforms supported by Nokia for Qt.
    \ingroup platform-specific

    The Qt team strives to provide support for the platforms most
    frequently used by Qt users. We have designed our internal testing procedure to
    divide platforms into three test categories (Tier 1, Tier 2 and Tier 3) in order
    to prioritize internal testing and development resources so that the most
    frequently used platforms are subjected to our most rigorous testing processes.

    Qt is supported on a variety of 32-bit and 64-bit platforms, and can
    usually be built on each platform with GCC, a vendor-supplied compiler, or
    a third party compiler. Although Qt may be built on a range of platform-compiler
    combinations, only a subset of these are actively supported by Nokia.

    \tableofcontents

    Information about the specific platforms Qt runs on can be found on the
    \l{Platform Notes} page. Information about the compilers used on each platform
    can be found on the \l{Compiler Notes} page.

    \section1 Tier 1 Platforms

    All Tier 1 platforms are subjected to our unit test suite and other internal
    testing tools on a frequent basis (prior to new version releases, source tree
    branching, and at other significant period points in the development process).
    Errors or bugs discovered in these platforms are prioritized for correction
    by the development team. Significant errors discovered in Tier 1 platforms can
    impact release dates and Qt Development Frameworks strives to resolve all known
    high priority errors in Tier 1 platforms prior to new version releases.

    \section1 Tier 2 Platforms

    Tier 2 platforms are subject to ad hoc and internal testing. However, Qt users
	should note that errors may be present in released product versions for Tier 2
	platforms and, subject to resource availability, known errors in Tier 2 platforms
	may or may not be corrected prior to new version releases.

    \section1 Tier 3 Platforms (Not supported by Nokia)

    All platforms not specifically listed above are not supported by Nokia. Nokia does
    not run its unit test suite or perform any other internal tests on platforms not
    listed above.

    Even though some Tier 3 platforms are available under the Qt Commercial License,
    technical support is not included in that license.
    However, \l{How to Order}{contact our sales team} to find out about the
    availability of other services for those platforms.

    Qt users should note, however, that there may be various open source
    projects, community users and/or Qt partners who are able to provide assistance with
    platforms not supported by Nokia.

    \section1 General Legal Disclaimer

    Please note that Qt is offered on an "as is" basis without warranty
    of any kind and that our products are not error or bug free. To the maximum extent
    permitted by applicable law, Nokia on behalf of itself and its suppliers, disclaims all
