    \title Third-Party Licenses Used in Qt
    \ingroup licensing
    \brief License information for third-party libraries supplied with Qt.

    Qt includes a number of third-party libraries that are used to provide
    certain features. Unlike the code described in the
    \l{Other Licenses Used in Qt}{code used in Qt} document, these
    libraries are supplied alongside the Qt modules.

    Third Party Software may impose additional restrictions and it is the
    user's responsibility to ensure that they have met the licensing
    requirements of the GPL, LGPL, or Qt Commercial license and the relevant
    license of the Third Party Software they are using.

    Run \c{configure -help} to see any options that may be available for
    controlling the use of these libraries.

    \section1 FreeType 2 (\c freetype) version 2.3.6

    \e{The FreeType project is a team of volunteers who develop free, portable
    and high-quality software solutions for digital typography. We specifically

    See also the files in \c src/3rdparty/harfbuzz, which are used by
    FreeType.

    Parts of the FreeType projects have been modified and put into Qt
    for use in the painting subsystem. These files are ftraster.h,
    ftraster.c, ftgrays.h and ftgrays.c. The following modifications
    has been made to these files:

    \list
    \i Renamed FT_ and ft_ symbols to QT_FT_ and qt_ft_ to avoid name
    conflicts.
    \i Removed parts of code not relevant when compiled with
    _STANDALONE_ defined.
    \i Changed behavior in ftraster.c to follow X polygon filling
    rules.
    \i Implemented support in ftraster.c for winding / odd even
    polygon fill rules.
    \i Replaced bitmap generation with span generation in ftraster.c
    \i Renamed: ftraster.h to qblackraster_p.h
    \i Renamed: ftraster.c to qblackraster.c

    better comes along, should serve our purposes.) In addition to porting to
    FreeType-2, it has been modified in various other ways.} -- quoted from

    are not its strong suit.  JPEG is lossy, meaning that the output image is not
    exactly identical to the input image.} -- quoted from \c
