    \title XML HTML Info Example

    The XML HTML Info example provides a simple command line utility that
    scans the current directory for HTML files and prints statistics about
    them to standard out.
    
    \note Standard out is redirected on some platforms. On Symbian using Open
    C \c stdout is by default directed to the console window, but this window
    may not always be visible. To redirect to a file instead, locate the \c
    c:\\system\\data\\config.ini file (on either the emulator or the device)
    and change \c STDOUT to point to \c MEDIA4. This will redirect the console
    to \c c:\\system\\data\\out.txt.
    
    The files are parsed using a QXmlStreamReader object. If the file does
    not contain a well-formed XML document, a description of the error is
    printed to the standard error console.

    \section1 Basic Operation

    The main function of the example uses QDir to access files in the current
    directory that match either "*.htm" or "*.html". For each file found,
    the \c parseHtmlFile() function is called.

    Reading XML is handled by an instance of the QXmlStreamReader class, which
    operates on the input file object:

    \snippet examples/xml/htmlinfo/main.cpp 0

    The work of parsing and the XML and extracting statistics is done in a
    while loop, and is driven by input from the reader:

    \snippet examples/xml/htmlinfo/main.cpp 1

    If more input is available, the next token from the input file is read
    and parsed. The program then looks for the specific element types,
    "title", "a", and "p", and stores information about them.

    When there is no more input, the loop terminates. If an error occurred,
    information is written to the standard out file via a stream, and the
    example exits:

    \snippet examples/xml/htmlinfo/main.cpp 2

    If no error occurred, the example prints some statistics from the data
    gathered in the loop, and then exits.
