    \title Trivial Wizard Example

    The Trivial Wizard example illustrates how to create a linear three-page
    registration wizard using three instances of QWizardPage and one instance
    of QWizard.

    \section1 Introduction Page

    \image trivialwizard-example-introduction.png

    The introduction page is created with the \c createIntroPage()
    function where a QWizardPage is created and its title is set to
    "Introduction". A QLabel is used to hold the description of \c page.
    A QVBoxLayout is used to hold the \c label. This \c page is returned
    when the \c createIntroPage() function is called.

    \section1 Registration Page

    \image trivialwizard-example-registration.png

    The registration page is created with the \c createRegistrationPage()
    function. QLineEdit objects are used to allow the user to input a name
    and an e-mail address. A QGridLayout is used to hold the QLabel and
    QLineEdit objects.

    \section1 Conclusion Page

    \image trivialwizard-example-conclusion.png

    The conclusion page is created in the \c createConclusionPage()
    function. This function's content is similar to \c createIntroPage(). A
    QLabel is used to inform the user that the registration process has
    completed successfully.

    \section1 \c main() Function

    The \c main() function instantiates a QWizard object, \c wizard, and
    adds all three QWizardPage objects to it. The \c wizard window title is
    set to "Trivial Wizard" and its \c show() function is invoked to display
    it.
