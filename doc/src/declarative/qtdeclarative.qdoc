  \title QtDeclarative Module
  \ingroup modules

  \brief The Qt Declarative module provides a declarative framework
  for building highly dynamic, custom user interfaces.

  To include the definitions of the module's classes, use the
  following directive:

  \code
  #include <QtDeclarative>
  \endcode

  To link against the module, add this line to your \l qmake \c
  .pro file:

  \code
  QT += declarative
  \endcode

  For more information on the Qt Declarative module, see the
  \l{Qt Quick} documentation.
*/


/*!
  \macro QML_DECLARE_TYPE()
  \relates QDeclarativeEngine

  Equivalent to \c Q_DECLARE_METATYPE(TYPE) and \c Q_DECLARE_METATYPE(QDeclarativeListProperty<TYPE>)
*/

/*!
  \macro QML_DECLARE_TYPEINFO(Type,Flags)
  \relates QDeclarativeEngine

  Declares additional properties of the given \a Type as described by the
  specified \a Flags.
  
  Current the only supported type info is \c QML_HAS_ATTACHED_PROPERTIES which
  declares that the \a Type supports \l {Attached Properties}.
*/


/*!
  \fn int qmlRegisterType(const char *uri, int versionMajor, int versionMinor, const char *qmlName)
  \relates QDeclarativeEngine

  This template function registers the C++ type in the QML system with
  the name \a qmlName, in the library imported from \a uri having the
  version number composed from \a versionMajor and \a versionMinor.

  Returns the QML type id.

  For example, this registers a C++ class \c MySliderItem as a QML type
  named \c Slider for version 1.0 of a \l{QML Modules}{module} called
  "com.mycompany.qmlcomponents":

  \code
  qmlRegisterType<MySliderItem>("com.mycompany.qmlcomponents", 1, 0, "Slider");
  \endcode

  Once this is registered, the type can be used in QML by importing the 
  specified module name and version number:

  \qml
  import com.mycompany.qmlcomponents 1.0

  Slider { ... }
  \endqml

  Note that it's perfectly reasonable for a library to register types to older versions
  than the actual version of the library. Indeed, it is normal for the new library to allow
  QML written to previous versions to continue to work, even if more advanced versions of
  some of its types are available.

/*!
  \fn int qmlRegisterUncreatableType(const char *uri, int versionMajor, int versionMinor, const char *qmlName, const QString& message)
  \relates QDeclarativeEngine

  This template function registers the C++ type in the QML system with
  the name \a qmlName, in the library imported from \a uri having the
  version number composed from \a versionMajor and \a versionMinor.

  While the type has a name and a type, it cannot be created, and the
  given error \a message will result if creation is attempted.

  This is useful where the type is only intended for providing attached properties or enum values.

  Returns the QML type id.

  \sa qmlRegisterTypeNotAvailable()
*/

/*!
  \fn int qmlRegisterTypeNotAvailable(const char *uri, int versionMajor, int versionMinor, const char *qmlName, const QString& message)
  \relates QDeclarativeEngine

  This function registers a type in the QML system with the name \a qmlName, in the library imported from \a uri having the
  version number composed from \a versionMajor and \a versionMinor, but any attempt to instantiate the type
  will produce the given error \a message.

  Normally, the types exported by a module should be fixed. However, if a C++ type is not available, you should
  at least "reserve" the QML type name, and give the user of your module a meaningful error message.

  Returns the QML type id.

  Example:

  \code
  #ifdef NO_GAMES_ALLOWED
  qmlRegisterTypeNotAvailable("MinehuntCore", 0, 1, "Game", "Get back to work, slacker!");
  #else
  qmlRegisterType<MinehuntGame>("MinehuntCore", 0, 1, "Game");
  #endif
  \endcode

  This will cause any QML which uses this module and attempts to use the type to produce an error message:
  \code
  fun.qml: Get back to work, slacker!
     Game {
     ^
  \endcode

  Without this, a generic "Game is not a type" message would be given.

  \sa qmlRegisterUncreatableType()
*/

/*!
  \fn int qmlRegisterType()
  \relates QDeclarativeEngine
  \overload

  This template function registers the C++ type in the QML
  system. Instances of this type cannot be created from the QML
  system.

  Returns the QML type id.
*/

/*!
  \fn int qmlRegisterInterface(const char *typeName)
  \relates QDeclarativeEngine

  This template function registers the C++ type in the QML system
  under the name \a typeName.

  Returns the QML type id.
