class QLibrary;

//! The base class for accressing special meego graphics system features. 
/*!
 This class is a helper class with static-only methods for accessing various
 meego graphics system functionalities. The way it works is that the helper
 dynamically calls-in to the loaded graphicssystem plugin... therefore, you're 
 expected to make sure that you're indeed running with 'meego' before using any
 of the specialized methods. 

 In example:

 \code
 QPixmap p;
 if (QMeeGoGraphicsSystemHelper::isRunningMeeGo()) {
    p = QMeeGoGraphicsSystemHelper::pixmapWithGLTexture(64, 64);
 } else {
    p = QPixmap(64, 64);
 }
 \endcode

 Calling any of the meego-specific features while not running meego might
 give unpredictable results. The only functions safe to call at all times are:

 \code
 QMeeGoGraphicsSystemHelper::isRunningMeeGo();
 QMeeGoGraphicsSystemHelper::runningGraphicsSystemName(); 
 QMeeGoGraphicsSystemHelper::switchToMeeGo();
 QMeeGoGraphicsSystemHelper::switchToRaster();
 \endcode

     This returns both true if the app was started with 'meego' or was started with

     switching is 'meego'.

    static bool isRunningMeeGo();

     When running with the 'runtime' graphics system, sets the currently active

     Creates a new QPixmap from the given EGL shared image handle. The QPixmap can be 
     used for painting like any other pixmap. The softImage should point to an alternative, 
     software version of the graphical resource -- ie. obtained from theme daemon. The 
     softImage can be allocated on a QSharedMemory slice for easy sharing across processes
     too. When the application is migrated ToRaster, this softImage will replace the
     contents of the sharedImage.
     
     It's ok to call this function too when not running 'meego' graphics system. In this
     case it'll create a QPixmap backed with a raster data (from softImage)... but when 
     the system is switched back to 'meego', the QPixmap will be migrated to a EGL-shared image
     backed storage (handle).

     which are backed by a software engine and only migrated to GPU when used. Migrating those
     GL-backed pixmaps when going ToRaster is expsensive (they need to be downloaded from 
     GPU to CPU) so use wisely.
