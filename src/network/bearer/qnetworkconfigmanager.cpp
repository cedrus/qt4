    \class QNetworkConfigurationManager

    \brief The QNetworkConfigurationManager class manages the network configurations provided
    by the system.

    \since 4.7

    \inmodule QtNetwork
    \ingroup network

    QNetworkConfigurationManager provides access to the network configurations known to the system and
    enables applications to detect the system capabilities (with regards to network sessions) at runtime.

    A QNetworkConfiguration abstracts a set of configuration options describing how a
    network interface has to be configured to connect to a particular target network.
    QNetworkConfigurationManager maintains and updates the global list of
    QNetworkConfigurations. Applications can access and filter this list via
    allConfigurations(). If a new configuration is added or an existing one is removed or changed
    the configurationAdded(), configurationRemoved() and configurationChanged() signals are emitted
    respectively.

    The defaultConfiguration() can be used when intending to immediately create a new
    network session without caring about the particular configuration. It returns
    a \l QNetworkConfiguration::Discovered configuration. If there are not any
    discovered ones an invalid configuration is returned.

    Some configuration updates may require some time to perform updates. A WLAN scan is
    such an example. Unless the platform performs internal updates it may be required to
    manually trigger configuration updates via QNetworkConfigurationManager::updateConfigurations().
    The completion of the update process is indicted by emitting the updateCompleted()
    signal. The update process ensures that every existing QNetworkConfiguration instance
    is updated. There is no need to ask for a renewed configuration list via allConfigurations().

    \sa QNetworkConfiguration
*/

/*! 
    \fn void QNetworkConfigurationManager::configurationAdded(const QNetworkConfiguration& config)

    This signal is emitted whenever a new network configuration is added to the system. The new
    configuration is specified by \a config.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QNetworkConfigurationManager::configurationRemoved(const QNetworkConfiguration& configuration)

    This signal is emitted when a configuration is about to be removed from the system. The removed
    \a configuration is invalid but retains name and identifier.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QNetworkConfigurationManager::updateCompleted()

    This signal is emitted when the configuration update has been completed. Such an update can
    be initiated via \l updateConfigurations().
*/

/*! \fn void QNetworkConfigurationManager::configurationChanged(const QNetworkConfiguration& config)

    This signal is emitted when the \l {QNetworkConfiguration::state()}{state} of \a config changes.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QNetworkConfigurationManager::onlineStateChanged(bool isOnline)

    This signal is emitted when the device changes from online to offline mode or vice versa.
    \a isOnline represents the new state of the device.

    The state is considered to be online for as long as
    \l{allConfigurations()}{allConfigurations}(QNetworkConfiguration::Active) returns a list with
    at least one entry.
*/

/*!
    \enum QNetworkConfigurationManager::Capability

    Specifies the system capabilities of the bearer API. The possible values are:

    \value CanStartAndStopInterfaces Network sessions and their underlying access points can be
                                     started and stopped. If this flag is not set QNetworkSession
                                     can only monitor but not influence the state of access points.
                                     On some platforms this feature may require elevated user
                                     permissions. This option is platform specific and may not
                                     always be available.
    \value DirectConnectionRouting   Network sessions and their sockets can be bound to a
                                     particular network interface. Any packet that passes through
                                     the socket goes to the specified network interface and thus
                                     disregards standard routing table entries. This may be useful
                                     when two interfaces can reach overlapping IP ranges or an
                                     application has specific needs in regards to target networks.
                                     This option is platform specific and may not always be
                                     available.
    \value SystemSessionSupport      If this flag is set the underlying platform ensures that a
                                     network interface is not shut down until the last network
                                     session has been \l{QNetworkSession::close()}{closed()}. This
                                     works across multiple processes. If the platform session
                                     support is missing this API can only ensure the above behavior
                                     for network sessions within the same process.
                                     In general mobile platforms (such as Symbian/S60) have such
                                     support whereas most desktop platform lack this capability.
    \value ApplicationLevelRoaming   The system gives applications control over the systems roaming
                                     behavior. Applications can initiate roaming (in case the
                                     current link is not suitable) and are consulted if the system
                                     has identified a more suitable access point.
    \value ForcedRoaming             The system disconnects an existing access point and reconnects
                                     via a more suitable one. The application does not have any
                                     control over this process and has to reconnect its active
                                     sockets.
    \value DataStatistics            If this flag is set QNetworkSession can provide statistics
                                     about transmitted and received data.
    \value NetworkSessionRequired    If this flag is set the platform requires that a network
                                     session is created before network operations can be performed.

    Returns the list of configurations which comply with the given \a filter.

    By default this function returns all (defined and undefined) configurations.

    A wireless network with a particular SSID may only be accessible in a
    certain area despite the fact that the system has a valid configuration
    for it. Therefore the filter flag may be used to limit the list to
    discovered and possibly connected configurations only.

    If \a filter is set to zero this function returns all possible configurations.

    Note that this function returns the states for all configurations as they are known at
    the time of this function call. If for instance a configuration of type WLAN is defined
    the system may have to perform a WLAN scan in order to determine whether it is
    actually available. To obtain the most accurate state updateConfigurations() should
    be used to update each configuration's state. Note that such an update may require
    some time. It's completion is signalled by updateCompleted(). In the absence of a
    configuration update this function returns the best estimate at the time of the call.
    Therefore, if WLAN configurations are of interest, it is recommended that
    updateConfigurations() is called once after QNetworkConfigurationManager
    instantiation (WLAN scans are too time consuming to perform in constructor).
    After this the data is kept automatically up-to-date as the system reports
    any changes.
