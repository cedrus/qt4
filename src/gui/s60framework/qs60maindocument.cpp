  \class QS60MainDocument
  \since 4.6
  \brief The QS60MainDocument class is a helper class for S60 migration.

  \warning This class is provided only to get access to S60 specific
  functionality in the application framework classes. It is not
  portable. We strongly recommend against using it in new applications.

  The QS60MainDocument provides a helper class for use in migrating
  from existing S60 based applications to Qt based applications. It is
  used in the exact same way as the \c CEikDocument class from
  Symbian, but internally provides extensions used by Qt.

  When modifying old S60 applications that rely on implementing
  functions in \c CEikDocument, the class should be modified to
  inherit from this class instead of \c CEikDocument. Then the
  application can choose to override only certain functions.

  For more information on \c CEikDocument, please see the S60
  documentation.

  Unlike other Qt classes, QS60MainDocument behaves like an S60 class,
  and can throw Symbian leaves.
