    \class QThread
    \brief The QThread class provides platform-independent threads.

    \ingroup thread

    A QThread represents a separate thread of control within the
    program; it shares data with all the other threads within the
    process but executes independently in the way that a separate
    program does on a multitasking operating system. Instead of
    starting in \c main(), QThreads begin executing in run().  By
    default, run() starts the event loop by calling exec() (see
    below). To create your own threads, subclass QThread and
    reimplement run(). For example:

    \snippet doc/src/snippets/code/src_corelib_thread_qthread.cpp 0

    This will create a QTcpSocket in the thread and then execute the
    thread's event loop. Use the start() method to begin execution.
    Execution ends when you return from run(), just as an application
    does when it leaves main(). QThread will notifiy you via a signal
    when the thread is started(), finished(), and terminated(), or
    you can use isFinished() and isRunning() to query the state of
    the thread. Use wait() to block until the thread has finished
    execution.

    Each thread gets its own stack from the operating system. The
    operating system also determines the default size of the stack.
    You can use setStackSize() to set a custom stack size.

    Each QThread can have its own event loop. You can start the event
    loop by calling exec(); you can stop it by calling exit() or
    quit(). Having an event loop in a thread makes it possible to
    connect signals from other threads to slots in this thread, using
    a mechanism called \l{Qt::QueuedConnection}{queued
    connections}. It also makes it possible to use classes that
    require the event loop, such as QTimer and QTcpSocket, in the
    thread. Note, however, that it is not possible to use any widget
    classes in the thread.

    In extreme cases, you may want to forcibly terminate() an
    executing thread. However, doing so is dangerous and discouraged.
    Please read the documentation for terminate() and
    setTerminationEnabled() for detailed information.

    The static functions currentThreadId() and currentThread() return
    identifiers for the currently executing thread. The former
    returns a platform specific ID for the thread; the latter returns
    a QThread pointer.

    QThread also provides platform independent sleep functions in
    varying resolutions. Use sleep() for full second resolution,
    msleep() for millisecond resolution, and usleep() for microsecond
    resolution.

        {Mandelbrot Example}, {Semaphores Example}, {Wait Conditions Example}

/*!
    \fn Qt::HANDLE QThread::currentThreadId()

    Returns the thread handle of the currently executing thread.

    \warning The handle returned by this function is used for internal
    purposes and should not be used in any application code.

    \warning On Windows, the returned value is a pseudo-handle for the
    current thread. It can't be used for numerical comparison. i.e.,
    this function returns the DWORD (Windows-Thread ID) returned by
    the Win32 function getCurrentThreadId(), not the HANDLE
    (Windows-Thread HANDLE) returned by the Win32 function
    getCurrentThread().
*/

/*!
    \fn int QThread::idealThreadCount()

    Returns the ideal number of threads that can be run on the system. This is done querying
    the number of processor cores, both real and logical, in the system. This function returns -1
    if the number of processor cores could not be detected.
*/

/*!

    if any. Note that the operating system decides to which thread to
    switch.
*/

/*!
    \fn void QThread::start(Priority priority)

    Begins execution of the thread by calling run(), which should be
    reimplemented in a QThread subclass to contain your code. The
    operating system will schedule the thread according to the \a
    priority parameter. If the thread is already running, this
    function does nothing.

    The effect of the \a priority parameter is dependent on the
    operating system's scheduling policy. In particular, the \a priority
    will be ignored on systems that do not support thread priorities
    (such as on Linux, see http://linux.die.net/man/2/sched_setscheduler
    for more details).

    This enum type indicates how the operating system should schedule
    newly created threads.

    \value LowPriority scheduled less often than NormalPriority.

    \value NormalPriority the default priority of the operating
           system.
