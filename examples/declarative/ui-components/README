With Qt Declarative, it is easy to implement the UI components that you need
in exactly the way that you want. These examples demonstrate this by creating
a selection of user interface components where the look and feel has been
completely defined in a QML file.

The example launcher provided with Qt can be used to explore each of the
examples in this directory. But most can also be viewed directly with the
QML viewer utility, without requiring compilation.

Documentation for these examples can be found via the Tutorials and Examples
link in the main Qt documentation.


Finding the Qt Examples and Demos launcher
==========================================

On Windows:

The launcher can be accessed via the Windows Start menu. Select the menu
entry entitled "Qt Examples and Demos" entry in the submenu containing
the Qt tools.

On Mac OS X:

For the binary distribution, the qtdemo executable is installed in the
/Developer/Applications/Qt directory. For the source distribution, it is
installed alongside the other Qt tools on the path specified when Qt is
configured.

On Unix/Linux:

The qtdemo executable is installed alongside the other Qt tools on the path
specified when Qt is configured.

On all platforms:

The source code for the launcher can be found in the demos/qtdemo directory
in the Qt package. This example is built at the same time as the Qt libraries,
tools, examples, and demonstrations.
